Monitoring these signals provides valuable geophysical information\u2014such as Earth\u2019s internal structure and event characteristics\u2014and is therefore useful for scientific research, education, and hobbyist networks.\\n\\nCompared with local earthquakes, teleseismic waves exhibit **much lower frequencies**, typically **below 2 Hz** (Fig. 1), and significantly smaller amplitudes. For example, when an earthquake from Alaska arrives in the Philippines, its dominant frequency content often lies in the **1/f noise\u2013dominated band**, making the useful signal easily masked and the seismic phases difficult to detect reliably.\\n\\nOn the other hand, traditional seismic instruments such as **force-balance accelerometers (FBA)** and **very-broadband (VBB)** seismometers offer excellent low-frequency response and high SNR, but their cost is prohibitive for individuals, schools, or small research groups.\\n\\n![1](img/2025-12-12-teleseismic-on-a-limited-budget/teleseismic-event.png)\\n\\nWith the rise of low-cost sensors, open-source hardware, and inexpensive microcontrollers, **low-cost teleseismic monitoring has become feasible**. This application note discusses how to implement a teleseismic monitoring system under budget constraints, including sensor selection, data acquisition architecture, cost-performance trade-offs, and deployment considerations.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n## Sensor Selection\\n\\nIn a teleseismic monitoring system, the sensor is the core component that determines overall data quality and usability. A capable teleseismic sensor must satisfy requirements in frequency response, noise performance, dynamic range, and long-term stability.\\n\\n[ADI\u2019s documentation on seismic monitoring](https://www.analog.com/en/resources/analog-dialogue/articles/understanding-the-fundamentals-of-earthquake-signal-sensing-networks.html) and structural sensing highlights that modern seismic systems must achieve a balanced compromise between **cost and performance**, and must adopt sensing technology appropriate to the intended application.\\n\\nThis section compares the commonly used sensor types\u2014**MEMS accelerometers** and **geophones**\u2014and provides technical recommendations specifically for teleseismic monitoring.\\n\\n### MEMS Accelerometers\\n\\nMEMS accelerometers use microfabricated mechanical structures to convert ground motion into electrical signals. They are widely used in portable acceleration sensing and structural vibration monitoring. A typical device consists of a silicon proof mass suspended by thin flexures, forming differential capacitors with fixed electrodes. Motion of the mass changes capacitance, which is then converted into a voltage proportional to acceleration (Fig. 2).\\n\\n![2](img/2025-12-12-teleseismic-on-a-limited-budget/model-of-mems-accelerometer.png)\\n\\nThe main advantages of MEMS accelerometers include compact size, low power consumption, and seamless integration with low-cost microcontrollers and SoCs.\\n\\nThe frequency response of most MEMS accelerometers resembles a low-pass filter with a cutoff at the mechanical resonance frequency. Because of offset drift, MEMS devices typically perform **better at frequencies relatively close to\u2014but below\u2014the resonance**, and degrade rapidly toward the extremely low-frequency band (Fig. 3).\\n\\n![3](img/2025-12-12-teleseismic-on-a-limited-budget/adxl355-frequency-response.png)\\n\\nAt low frequencies, MEMS accelerometers exhibit significant **1/f noise** (flicker noise), originating from mechanical friction, charge trapping, and low-frequency drift in the internal amplifier. As frequency decreases, noise density increases. Even in the absence of motion, random low-frequency fluctuations can appear comparable to real teleseismic amplitudes (Fig. 4).\\n\\n![4](img/2025-12-12-teleseismic-on-a-limited-budget/flicker-noise.png)\\n\\nLow-frequency MEMS output is further affected by:\\n\\n- **Sensor bias drift**: Long-term baseline drift behaves like 1/f noise and reduces weak-signal detectability.\\n- **Temperature-induced offset drift**: Temperature variation causes baseline shifts over time, often exceeding the amplitude of teleseismic signals.\\n\\nCombined 1/f noise, offset drift, and temperature effects severely limit MEMS SNR in the teleseismic band (< 2 Hz). Weak P, S, and surface waves may be obscured. Even with software filtering, numerical integration, or temperature compensation, accurate velocity or displacement reconstruction remains difficult.\\n\\nTo address these issues, manufacturers such as **EPSON** introduced ultra-low-noise quartz-resonant MEMS accelerometers ([link](https://www.epsondevice.com/sensing/en/products/accelerometer/feature/)). Although significantly more stable, they cost hundreds of times more than standard low-noise MEMS devices. Thus, while MEMS accelerometers perform well in low-cost structural monitoring or local earthquake detection, they are not suitable as primary sensors for high-quality teleseismic monitoring.\\n\\n### Geophones\\n\\nGeophones are velocity sensors that use a mass-spring and coil-magnet structure to convert ground motion into electrical signals. They output velocity directly, eliminating the need for integration in seismic phase analysis.\\n\\nBased on internal topology, geophones come in moving-coil and moving-magnet types (Fig. 5):\\n\\n![5](img/2025-12-12-teleseismic-on-a-limited-budget/geophone-types.png)\\n\\nThey work similarly; the difference lies in which component moves:\\n\\n- **Moving-coil**: The housing and permanent magnet remain fixed, while the coil\u2014mounted to the suspended mass\u2014moves.\\n- **Moving-magnet**: The housing and coil assembly remain fixed, while the permanent magnet is attached to the suspended mass.\\n\\nAlthough their operating principles are almost identical and overall performance is comparable, moving-coil designs are easier to manufacture and therefore more widely used in seismic exploration and teleseismic monitoring.\\n\\nThe transfer function of a geophone can be expressed as:\\n\\n![Transfer Function](img/2025-12-12-teleseismic-on-a-limited-budget/geophone_transfer_function.png)\\n\\nWhere:\\n\\n- **K\u2080** \u2014 Open-loop sensitivity (V/m/s)\\n- **\u03c9\u2080** \u2014 Natural angular frequency (rad/s), with \u03c9\u2080 = 2\u03c0f\u2080\\n- **f\u2080** \u2014 Resonant frequency\\n- **\u03be\u2080** \u2014 Damping ratio\\n\\nAssuming a geophone with parameters:\\n\\n- f\u2080 = 4.5 Hz\\n- K\u2080 = 100 V/m/s\\n- \u03be\u2080 = 0.65\\n\\nThe simulated frequency response is shown in Fig. 6.\\n\\n![6](img/2025-12-12-teleseismic-on-a-limited-budget/geophone-freq-phase-simulation.png)\\n\\nAs illustrated, above the resonant frequency the velocity response is approximately flat, whereas below resonance the output rolls off rapidly.\\n\\nFor most low-cost applications, **4.5 Hz geophones** are the best choice (Fig. 7). Lower-frequency geophones (e.g., 2 Hz) cost ~10\xd7 more, while higher-frequency ones (e.g., 10 Hz) have poor low-frequency response and are unsuitable for teleseismic monitoring.\\n\\n![7](img/2025-12-12-teleseismic-on-a-limited-budget/geophone-in-real-world.webp)\\n\\nTo extend the bandwidth and improve low-frequency response, external compensation networks are commonly applied to reshape the geophone transfer function. Several approaches exist:\\n\\n- **Passive servo compensation**: This method uses an RC network placed in parallel with the geophone output to increase the effective mass of the moving system and thereby lower the resonant frequency (Fig. 8). However:\\n\\n    - The resulting damping ratio becomes **greater than 1**, deviating from the optimal value (\u22480.707).\\n    - Sensitivity decreases significantly.\\n    - Large capacitors often exhibit poor temperature stability, degrading overall performance.\\n\\n    ![8](img/2025-12-12-teleseismic-on-a-limited-budget/passive-servo-compensation.png)\\n\\n- **Feedback compensation**: A controlled current is injected into the geophone coil. This current generates a corrective force on the suspended mass. A positive-feedback filter\u2014typically integrative\u2014derives this current from the geophone output (Fig. 9). This effectively amplifies low-frequency mass motion, extending bandwidth. However:\\n\\n    - Designing a stable positive-feedback loop is **difficult**.\\n    - Phase margin and loop stability must be strictly maintained.\\n\\n    ![9](img/2025-12-12-teleseismic-on-a-limited-budget/feedback-compensation.png)\\n\\n- **Pole-zero compensation** (recommended): Pole-zero compensation inserts a correction network in series with the geophone so that the zeros of the correction network cancel the poles of the original sensor. The modified system\u2019s poles then become those of the external network (Fig. 10).\\n\\n    Advantages:\\n\\n    - Does **not modify** the geophone\u2019s internal mechanical characteristics\\n    - Provides controlled and predictable frequency shaping\\n    - Can be implemented in **analog circuitry or digital filters**\\n    - **Lowest cost** among practical compensation methods\\n\\n    This approach is widely regarded as the most effective technique for low-cost seismic instrumentation.\\n\\n    ![10](img/2025-12-12-teleseismic-on-a-limited-budget/pole-zero-compensation.png)\\n\\n## Data Acquisition Scheme\\n\\nData acquisition is critical in teleseismic monitoring. The objective is to convert the geophone\u2019s millivolt-level analog signal into a digital stream **without distortion, without adding significant noise, and with precise timing** for phase alignment across sensors.\\n\\nThree major components:\\n\\n1. **Signal preprocessing**\\n2. **ADC conversion**\\n3. **Data handling and transmission**\\n\\n### Input Voltage Clamping\\n\\nClamping limits input voltage to the ADC\u2019s safe range. For example, with \xb110 V ADC range, a clamp prevents over-range events using diode-based structures (Fig. 11).\\n\\n![11](img/2025-12-12-teleseismic-on-a-limited-budget/voltage-clamping-circuit.png)\\n\\n### Pre-Amplification\\n\\nLow-noise op-amps amplify the velocity signal to match ADC dynamic range. Zero-drift amplifiers such as **ADA4522** or **ADA4528** (Fig. 12) provide microvolt-level offsets and extremely low drift and 1/f noise\u2014ideal for low-frequency, weak signals.\\n\\n![12](img/2025-12-12-teleseismic-on-a-limited-budget/zero-drift-amplifier.jpg)\\n\\nIn low-cost designs, external amplifiers may be omitted and replaced with internal ADC PGA\u2014but internal PGAs have higher noise and limited input impedance.\\n\\n### Anti-Aliasing Filter\\n\\nAn anti-aliasing filter is used to suppress frequency components above the Nyquist frequency before the signal enters the ADC. Without proper filtering, high-frequency noise will fold back into the passband during sampling, resulting in irreversible contamination of the recorded data (see Fig. 13).\\n\\n![13](img/2025-12-12-teleseismic-on-a-limited-budget/signal-aliasing.png)\\n\\nA well-designed anti-aliasing filter is a critical part of the analog front-end, as it directly determines whether the ADC receives a clean signal and, consequently, whether the system can reliably detect low-frequency teleseismic events.\\n\\nFundamentally, the anti-aliasing filter is an **analog low-pass filter**, which may be implemented using passive or active circuitry. **Digital filtering cannot substitute for it**, since digital filtering occurs after sampling and therefore cannot prevent aliasing.\\n\\nIn practical designs, the cutoff frequency is typically chosen slightly below half the sampling frequency to ensure adequate roll-off. The quality of this filter is one of the most decisive factors affecting the ADC input integrity and the system\u2019s ability to resolve teleseismic signals in the low-frequency band.\\n\\n### Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC)\\n\\nThe ADC converts the extremely weak analog signal from the geophone into digital samples. As the most critical and cost-intensive component in the acquisition chain, ADC selection must balance performance, stability, and supply availability.\\n\\nFor seismic monitoring applications, the essential ADC specifications include:\\n\\n- **Resolution:** Determines the smallest detectable change in signal. Seismic instruments typically use 24-bit converters.\\n- **Effective Number of Bits (ENOB):** More meaningful than nominal resolution; reflects real-world accuracy.\\n- **Dynamic Range:** Indicates the ability to measure very weak and very strong signals simultaneously.\\n- **Input-referred Noise:** The most important metric for seismic monitoring; sets the minimum detectable signal.\\n- **Sampling Rate:** Teleseismic monitoring generally requires 50\u2013200 SPS; the ADC must support stable operation at these rates.\\n- **Input Front-End Architecture:** Differential inputs, internal PGA structure, reference voltage design, etc.\\n- **Temperature Drift & Long-Term Stability:** Critical for continuous long-term recording.\\n- **Product Lifecycle (EoL status):** Avoid devices at or near end of life.\\n\\n**Delta-Sigma (\u0394-\u03a3)** ADCs are ideal for seismic- and audio-band applications due to:\\n\\n- Very high resolutions (commonly 24-bit)\\n- High oversampling ratios\\n- Extremely low input noise\\n- Wide dynamic ranges\\n\\nTheir weakness is limited bandwidth, making them unsuitable for high-speed sampling. Typical examples include:\\n\\n- ADS1256\\n- ADS127L01\\n- AD7768 series\\n- LTC2500 series\\n\\n**SAR (Successive Approximation)** ADCs are better suited for high-speed applications. However, for low-frequency micro-signal measurement, SAR noise and dynamic range are generally inferior to \u0394-\u03a3 converters. SAR devices may still be used for high-frequency seismic or SHM applications. Common examples include MCP3208 and LTC1867.\\n\\nFor low-cost seismic applications, a suitable \u0394-\u03a3 ADC should meet:\\n\\n- Input noise < **500 nV/\u221aHz** (0.1\u201310 Hz band)\\n- 24-bit resolution or higher\\n- True delta-sigma architecture\\n\\nReliable low-cost models include:\\n\\n- **ADS1256**\\n- **ADS131M0x family**\\n- **ADS131E0x family**\\n\\nThese devices offer adequate noise performance, dynamic range, and architectural robustness for teleseismic monitoring, while providing stable supply and strong community support.\\n\\nIn contrast, **ADS1115** or **the 12-bit ADCs built into boards such as BluePill** have extremely high noise and insufficient dynamic range, making them unsuitable for teleseismic applications. They are appropriate only for general-purpose sensing.\\n\\nFor higher-end seismic performance, dedicated exploration-grade ADCs such as **ADS1281 / ADS1285** offer superior noise and dynamic range, though at higher cost and greater design complexity. These fall outside the scope of this document.\\n\\n### Microcontroller Unit (MCU)\\n\\nThe MCU handles critical system functions including data acquisition, buffering, timing synchronization, communication, and interfacing with the ADC. Continuous long-term seismic monitoring requires a highly reliable MCU architecture with strong real-time performance.\\n\\nImportant selection criteria include:\\n\\n- **Reliability and 24/7 stability:** Must operate continuously under varying conditions.\\n- **Adequate processing capability:** Must reliably handle sustained ADC data streams and light filtering/packaging.\\n- **Stable peripheral interfaces:** Especially SPI, UART, timers, and DMA.\\n- **Support for precise time synchronization:** Required for GNSS 1PPS alignment.\\n- **Strong development ecosystem:** Comprehensive SDKs, documentation, and examples.\\n\\nWireless interfaces such as:\\n\\n- Wi-Fi\\n- BLE\\n- NB-IoT\\n- ZigBee\\n\\nshould generally be avoided. They generate electromagnetic noise that directly contaminates the seismic band (notably 1\u201320 Hz). Some manufacturers explicitly warn against enabling wireless radios during precision sensing.\\n\\nThus, wired communication is strongly preferred:\\n\\n- **UART / RS-232 / RS-485:** Low-cost, noise-resistant, reliable for point-to-point links.\\n- **Ethernet:** Suitable for long-distance, high-reliability data streaming to servers or SBCs.\\n\\nWhenever possible, choose an MCU with **DMA support**. DMA enables continuous data transfers from the ADC to memory without CPU intervention, reducing jitter and preventing sample loss\u2014critical for maintaining phase accuracy and long-term continuity in seismic records.\\n\\n**Recommended MCU family: STM32**\\n\\n- Stable SPI + DMA architecture ideal for \u0394-\u03a3 ADC data streams\\n- Rich timers for precise GNSS-1PPS synchronization\\n- Mature ecosystem and excellent long-term support\\n\\nPopular models include **STM32F103, STM32F303, STM32F411**, offering low cost and robust performance.\\n\\n**ESP32 / RP2040**, while attractive for hobby projects, are not recommended for high-quality teleseismic monitoring:\\n\\n- Severe Wi-Fi / PLL noise\\n- Unstable DMA systems\\n- High clock jitter\\n- Strong temperature drift\\n- Limited long-duration reliability\\n\\nIf used, wireless features must be entirely disabled.\\n\\n**Single-Board Computers (SBCs)** such as Raspberry Pi should not directly drive ADC sampling because:\\n\\n- Linux is non-real-time (indeterminate scheduling)\\n- SPI timing may jitter or drop frames\\n- Hard real-time sampling cannot be guaranteed\\n\\nSBCs are suitable as downstream processors for visualization and networking\u2014not for front-end sampling.\\n\\n## AnyShake Project: Open-Source Low-Cost Seismic Monitoring\\n\\nAnyShake Project is a fully open-source seismic and vibration monitoring system composed of the **AnyShake Explorer** hardware platform and the **AnyShake Observer** cross-platform software.
