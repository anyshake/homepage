**SensePlex Ltd.** is the company responsible for the development and maintenance of the **AnyShake** open-source seismograph platform. We are committed to delivering high-quality, community-driven solutions for seismic data acquisition, visualization, and research.

SensePlex was founded by a team of young engineers with backgrounds in seismology and embedded systems. We believe in the power of open hardware and software to advance science, education, and hobbyist exploration in the field of geophysics.

Our flagship product, **AnyShake Explorer**, is designed to offer professional-grade seismic sensing capabilities at an accessible price. It is fully open-source and supported by companion software, **AnyShake Observer**, which allows for real-time data monitoring and analysis across platforms.

At the hardware level, we primarily use **C** to develop and optimize firmware for embedded systems. For software and data processing, we adopt **Go** as our primary programming language. We are actively working to close the gap in geophysical software development by building a modern, efficient, and open-source toolchain in Go â€” a field that has seen little dedicated work until now.
