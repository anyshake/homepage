# Versioning

AnyShake Observer follows the [Semantic Versioning (SemVer)](https://semver.org) principles.

That means that with a version number x.y.z:

 - When releasing critical bug fixes, we make a patch release by changing the z number (ex: 2.1.2 to 2.1.3).
 - When releasing new features or non-critical fixes, we make a minor release by changing the y number (ex: 2.1.2 to 2.2.0).
 - When releasing breaking changes, we make a major release by changing the x number (ex: 2.1.2 to 3.0.0).

Major releases can also contain new features, and any release can include bug fixes, minor releases are the most common type of release.
