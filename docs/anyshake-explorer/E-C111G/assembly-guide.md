### 1. Component Overview & Pre-Check

Before assembly, verify the wiring polarity on all three geophones (N, E, Z channels). This is critical for correct waveform phases.

- **Wiring:** Ensure the **Red wire** is soldered to **(+)** and the **Black wire** to **(-)**.
- **Connection Rule:** When connecting to the board later, always match **Positive to Positive** and **Negative to Negative**.

### 2. Installing Leveling Screws

1.  **Identify Orientation:** Locate the hole on the acrylic base plate (marked in the video/diagram). This direction indicates **South**.
2.  **Install:** Remove the top nut from the leveling screw, insert the screw into the hole, and tighten the nut back on using the included screwdriver.
3.  **Repeat:** Perform this for all 3 feet.

### 3. Bracket Preparation (Standoffs)

The kit includes two lengths of screws. Pre-install the copper standoffs to make geophone placement easier.

1.  **Sort Screws:**
    - **Short Screws:** For holes along the edge of the rectangular slot.
    - **Long Screws:** For the specific holes designated for the Z-channel.
2.  **Secure Standoffs:** Screw them into the base to firmly attach the copper standoffs.
3.  **Prepare for Mounting:** Once the standoffs are tight against the plate, **remove the top screws**.

### 4. Geophone Placement

Follow the specific orientation and wiring direction for each channel.

- **Z-Axis Geophone**
    - **Hardware:** Long screws.
    - **Orientation:** Vertical.
    - **Wire Direction:** Pointing **Left**.
- **N-Axis Geophone**
    - **Hardware:** Short screws.
    - **Orientation:** Horizontal.
    - **Wire Direction:** Pointing **Down**.
- **E-Axis Geophone**
    - **Hardware:** Short screws.
    - **Orientation:** Horizontal.
    - **Wire Direction:** Pointing **Left**.

:::warning Tightening Torque

When securing the mounting plates, the tightening force is crucial for data quality:

- **Too Tight:** May deform the geophone structure and affect vibration detection.
- **Too Loose:** The geophone will wobble, introducing noise.
- **Correct Standard:** Tighten just enough so the geophone is firmly fixed and does not move.

### 1. Preparation

- **Check the Bottom Plate:** Ensure the leveling screws and geophones are already installed on the bottom plate.
- **Install the Screen:** Mount the small display screen onto the E-C111G mainboard.

### 2. Base & Board Assembly

- **Install Long Standoffs:** Take the 4 **long standoffs**. Insert them through the bottom plate and secure them tightly underneath with the nuts.
- **Place the Board:** Position the E-C111G board face up, aligning it with the four long standoffs.
- **Install Short Standoffs:** Take the 4 **short standoffs**. Thread the male end through the board's mounting holes and screw them into the long standoffs below.

:::tip Pro Tip
Do **not** tighten these completely just yet. Leaving a little "wiggle room" makes it much easier to align the top plate later.

### 3. Side Panels & Wiring

- **Wiring Panel (Critical):** Locate the side panel with the interface slots.
    - **Wiring Order:** Insert the wire terminals in the order of **Z, E, N** (from left to right).
    - **Polarity Check:** Double-check that the geophone polarity matches the positive/negative silkscreen markings on the board (`+` to `+`, `-` to `-`).
- **Other Panels:** Slot in the remaining side panels.
    - _Note:_ If the ports don't align perfectly with the slots, you may have the panel backwards—try flipping it around.

### 4. Finalizing the Assembly

- **Crucial Step:** Before closing the case, flip the power switch on the board (circled in red in the video) to the **"ON"** position. This ensures the device boots up automatically when plugged in.
- **Install Top Plate:** Place the top acrylic plate on the standoffs and secure the four corners using the small hex screws.
- **Finish:** Tighten all screws to ensure a sturdy build. You're done!
